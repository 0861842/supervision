    "In order to display bounding boxes on objects, we first need a way to detect those objects. We'll be using the open source [Inference](https://github.com/roboflow/inference) package for this task. Inference allows us to quickly use thousands of models, including fine tuned models from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/), in a few lines of code.  Along with this, we'll be utilizing some utilities for working with our video data from the [Supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision) package.
